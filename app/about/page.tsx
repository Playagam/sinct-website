        SINƇT is a devilish streetwear house forged for Gen-Z misfits. Each drop channels a sin with
        tactile hardware, heavy textures, and glow-reactive inks—heavily inspired by the energy of
        Genrage. We craft slow, intentional capsules that age like relics.

        Designed in shadow, built to be loud. Seven sins. Infinite drip.
